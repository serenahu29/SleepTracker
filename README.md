## Q1
We decided invalid undo attempts by having the undo button only respond to the first click, otherwise nothing is changed.

## Q2
We changed the color to be more blue-toned rather than the original pinked-toned, making it more calming and sleep-encouraging.

## Q3
We think it makes sense to have multiple activities for this app. Since even though it is the simple version, it would still be too cluttered if there was only one activity.
We think the current one is meeting the functional purposes, and it is simple to navigate, so we wouldn't make any changes to the design.

## Q4
We tested it mutiple times with different test cases (different number inputs, etc.).

## Q5
We had a hard time because this was our first time implementing app design on Android Studio. It required us too do a lot of self-learning and exploration.
